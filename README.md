The client-facing application of The Stuyvesant Spectator, built in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests from Spec Web developers and seasoned JavaScript developers alike! Please follow [these steps](CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute.

## Roadmap

For information on the things which are currently being focused on, please visit the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) file.

## Virtual Archive

Unfortunately, Issuu has updated its terms of service and made it impossible to embed issues of the newspaper without paying. As such, for the time being the Spectator is going to have a simple Virtual Archive thumbnail which is going to link to the Issuu page. 

## Setting Up

[WORK IN PROGRESS]

## Deploying

To push new features to the website, please make sure they work on your local repo first. After having your features merged into the ``develop`` branch, go into your local [stuy-spec-api](https://github.com/stuyspec/stuyspec-api) repo and run ``bundle exec cap production deploy``
