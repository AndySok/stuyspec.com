    uncover information about specific issues at Stuy, and more. We're a very fun, creative department,

    If you love writing stories, digging around, and writing some hard-hitting articles, then the Features Department is the place for you.`,

    and relevant issues happening in our Stuyvesant community and in the world beyond. 
    In each issue, a number of writers across all grades give their opinions on subjects ranging from politics to economics and from technology to culture. 
    The Opinions section often includes Point-Counter-Points and spreads that reflect a diverse set of beliefs and perspectives, 
    and use their stances to uncover a deeper understanding of the subject at hand. 
    The overarching goal is to create engaging, substantive, and relevant content to provide a closer look at the world.`,

        Throughout the half of a year on the department, I’ve had the opportunity to share many of my opinions which were once only told to my close friends 
        or family to a wider audience. With writing drafts and coming up with arguments, I’ve also seen myself grow as a writer in which I can support my 
        arguments more effectively. As teenagers, it’s easy to feel like our voices do not matter as much as adults, 
        but this department has allowed for many students’ voices to be recognized, and I find that very special.`,

    We are a low-commitment department and don’t have many meetings, so balancing this department and other extracurriculars won’t be a problem.`,

    where your art will be displayed for all of its readers to admire. The limits of your creativity have no bounds; 
    you can flaunt your skills in thematic spreads, comics, or Caption Contest illustrations! We encourage the use of all media!`,

        Drawing for the art department has been such a fantastic experience. The club meetings are incredibly fun and relaxing as well. 
        You can socialize with friends and feel free to be yourself.

    Typical assignments include portraits of students and teachers, photos at school events – including sports games – and shots of fun things around the city as well. 
    Photography is not just support for articles though, it is journalism in its own right. 
    Photo department members regularly contribute to or spearhead photo essay projects.\n\n
    The Spectator Photo department only hosts a few meetings each term, so the most work is coordinated via email. 
    Photo assignments are completed on the photographer’s own schedule, so long as they are in by department deadlines. 
    This department is a good fit for anyone interested in photography, whether you’re just starting out, 
    or you’re an expert looking for a place to practice and refine your skills.`,

        Taking assignments and going to events, meetings, and clubs that you’ve never even heard of before to take photos lets you 
        interact with the Stuyvesant community in a personal and unique way, you never know who you might meet. 
        If there’s any way to contribute to the Spectator, I wholeheartedly say the best way is through Photo!`,

    as an independent student-run newspaper, The Spectator is able to publish thousands of copies every issue because 
    of companies that place advertisements and agree to sponsorships. In order to continue this process, SpecBiz members have the responsibility 
    in contacting various businesses and acquiring advertisements and sponsorships for the newspaper. 
    Members are exposed to real life situations by learning proper etiquette, dealing with money, and communicating with adults in the real world.`,

        meeting with business managers throughout the city, and properly formatting emails. Joining this department was a life-changer,
